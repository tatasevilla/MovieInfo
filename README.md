# MovieInfo

This site was created from a Traversy Media tutorial, which can be accessed in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsPqjYGauns&ab_channel=TraversyMedia]. 
The application uses Javascript ES6,jQuery along with Axios for making HTML requeststothe OMBD API. The use of the API requires a key that is not provided in the tutorial:
'axios.get('https://wwww.omdbapi.com?s=' + searchText + '&apikey=9be27fce'). The same key can be used in the request for the 'data' in the MOVIE DETAILS
